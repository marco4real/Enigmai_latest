HI, GAME DEVELOPER !

THANKS FOR USING MY 'HORROR DEVELOPMENT KIT' I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT !

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SOMETHING, JUST SEE IF THE DOCUMENTATION CONTAINS A FIX
OR A GUIDE RELATED TO YOUR PROBLEM(S) BEFORE USING THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT!
YOU CAN ALSO SEE FROM THE DEMO SCENE HOW THE THINGS WORKS!

REMEMBER THAT THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT REQUIRES THAT YOU HAVE BOUGHT LEGALLY THE ASSET,
SO ANY FAKE OR INVALID REQUEST WILL JUST BE IGNORED AND DELETED.

THANKS,
JOHN'S ART <3
